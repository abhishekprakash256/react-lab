# React Learning & Testing Repository

Welcome to the **React Learning & Testing** repository! This project is a personal playground for exploring, learning, and experimenting with React, its ecosystem, and various testing frameworks. It’s built purely for educational purposes and self-improvement, offering a space to deepen understanding of React fundamentals, component-based development, and testing strategies.



## Project Overview
This repository contains multiple small projects and examples created to:
- Practice and reinforce React concepts.
- Experiment with different testing methods and libraries.
- Gain hands-on experience with real-world scenarios in a controlled environment.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Testing Library**: A library to help test React components in a user-focused way.
- **Bootstrap**: For styling and creating responsive components.
  
Additional libraries may be introduced as the learning path evolves.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** and **npm** (or **yarn**) installed.
  
### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:abhishekprakash256/React-Testing.git
   cd react-learning-testing
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in your browser.



## Learning Objectives
1. **React Basics**: Learn component-based architecture, state management, props, and component lifecycle.
2. **Hooks**: Explore React Hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, and custom hooks.
3. **Component Styling**: Style components with CSS, styled-components, and Bootstrap.
4. **Testing in React**:
   - Write unit tests for components.
   - Test interactions and UI behaviors.
   - Mock API calls and external libraries.

## Testing Strategies
This repository employs various testing strategies to ensure components function as expected:
- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components to verify they render and behave correctly in isolation.
- **Integration Testing**: Testing how components interact with each other.
- **Mocking and Stubbing**: Using mock data and functions to isolate test cases.

### Running Tests
Run all tests with:
```bash
npm test
```
or
```bash
yarn test
```
